"What is machine learning?",doc_001,"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed."
"How does neural networks work?",doc_002,"Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and learn patterns from data."
"What are the main types of machine learning?",doc_003,"The main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through trial and error."
"What is deep learning?",doc_004,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data."
"How do you evaluate machine learning models?",doc_005,"Machine learning models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. Cross-validation is also commonly used to assess model performance."
"What is natural language processing?",doc_006,"Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language."
"What are the challenges in AI?",doc_007,"Key challenges in AI include data quality and quantity, computational resources, interpretability, bias and fairness, and ensuring AI systems are safe and reliable."
"How does computer vision work?",doc_008,"Computer vision is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos, using algorithms and deep learning models."
"What is the difference between AI and machine learning?",doc_009,"Artificial intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider smart, while machine learning is a specific approach to achieve AI through algorithms that can learn from data."
"What are the applications of machine learning?",doc_010,"Machine learning has applications in healthcare (diagnosis and drug discovery), finance (fraud detection and trading), transportation (autonomous vehicles), marketing (recommendation systems), and many other fields."
